Project Euler #54 Solution
==========================

https://projecteuler.net/problem=54

This is my take at the answer for problem 54 of Euler in Ruby. Although the
rules specify that you can assume data integrity I rarely if ever have the
ability to make that assumption, so I created a full test suite and validation
handling to ensure success. This was an enjoyable exercise which was fun to
emblish upon.

* Run `bundle install` to download the `rspec` and `guard` dependencies.
* To run guard: `bundle exec guard`
* To run rspec on its own: `bundle exec rspec`
* To execute the program (from root dir): `bundle exec ruby run.rb`
